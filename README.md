# EVM
This project implements an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Raspberry Pi, integrating biometric and facial
recognition technology to authenticate voters before allowing them to cast their votes securely and conveniently.
By combining these advanced authentication methods with the affordability and accessibility of Raspberry Pi,
the project aims to enhance the integrity, efficiency, and inclusivity of the electoral process
